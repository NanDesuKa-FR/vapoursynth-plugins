The model file contains the network weights (a bunch 32-bit floating point values stored in binary format) that are a result of training on my image set. I could have included those values in tables in a big source file, but storing them in binary file was easier to me. The model file isn't under any license, you can do whatever you want with it. I never released the training program for learning the weights. I planned to, but never got around to it.

Subject: nnedi3 model weights binary file

Hi!
You needi3 avisynth plugin was released under GPL-2.
I assume that the nnedi3 model weights binary file is GPL-2 too.
However, I cannot find any kind of source file or documentation on how
to create or modify
this binary file, since the GPL would require the source to be available.
