HolyWu:

Here is my ported AviSynth scripts for VapourSynth.

Now includes:
    ediaa
    daa
    maa - Added 'noring' parameter to indicate that a non-ringing algorithm must be used in case of supersampling.
    SharpAAMCmod - Added 'noring' parameter to indicate that a non-ringing algorithm must be used in case of supersampling.
    Deblock_QED
    DeHalo_alpha - Added 'noring' parameter to indicate that a non-ringing algorithm must be used in case of supersampling.
    YAHR
    HQDering mod
    QTGMC - Add FFT3dGPU as another Denoiser to NoiseProcess. Since FFT3dGPU doesn't support bt=5, the maximum of NoiseTR is restricted to 1. Renamed 'DftThreads' parameter to 'DenoiseThreads'. The threads of FFT3DFilter is not set in the original version. Now 'DenoiseThreads' sets the threads of both dfttest and FFT3DFilter.
    ivtc_txt60mc
    Vinverse
    LUTDeCrawl
    LUTDeRainbow
    GrainStabilizeMC
    SMDegrain - Added 'MVglobal' and 'dct' parameters to be able to set the 'global' and 'dct' of MAnalyse.
    InterFrame
    FastLineDarken 1.4x MT MOD
    GammaToLinear, LinearToGamma
    LSFmod - Added 'noring' parameter to indicate that a non-ringing algorithm must be used in case of supersampling.
    GrainFactory3


Right now there is a pel=1 bug in MVTools of AVS version (http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?p=1600699#post1600699). Therefore remember to add pel=2 in SMDegrain if the script would set pel=1 in some circumstances/presets. There is a pel=1 bug fixed version here (http://www.svp-team.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=1069). But it doesnt support outputting stack16 format, so can't be used with SMDegrain if you want to enable lsb mode.

Since VapourSynth has no notion of field order internally, I have to add a mandatory argument 'TFF' to QTGMC for the script to work correctly. Setting TFF to true means top field first and false means bottom field first. You will get error if TFF is not set. The same thing applies to SMDegrain and ivtc_txt60mc.

BTW, Yadif seems can't be loaded in VapourSynth successfully, so I changed the default EdiMode of "Ultra Fast" preset to TDeint in QTGMC.

Usage Example:
Firstly, put havsfunc.py to Python\Lib\site-packages.

Code:
import vapoursynth as vs
import havsfunc
core = vs.get_core()
haf = havsfunc.HAvsFunc()
# Load the needed plugins #
clip = yourclip
clip = haf.QTGMC(clip, Preset='Medium', TFF=True)
