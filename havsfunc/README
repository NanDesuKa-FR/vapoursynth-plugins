HolyWu:

Here is my ported AviSynth scripts for VapourSynth.

Now includes:
    ediaa
    daa
    maa - Added 'noring' parameter to indicate that a non-ringing algorithm must be used in case of supersampling.
    SharpAAMCmod - Added 'noring' parameter to indicate that a non-ringing algorithm must be used in case of supersampling.
    Deblock_QED
    DeHalo_alpha - Added 'noring' parameter to indicate that a non-ringing algorithm must be used in case of supersampling.
    YAHR
    HQDering mod
    QTGMC - Add FFT3dGPU as another Denoiser to NoiseProcess. Since FFT3dGPU doesn't support bt=5, the maximum of NoiseTR is restricted to 1. Renamed 'DftThreads' parameter to 'DenoiseThreads'. The threads of FFT3DFilter is not set in the original version. Now 'DenoiseThreads' sets the threads of FFT3DFilter.
    ivtc_txt60mc
    Vinverse
    Vinverse2
    logoNR
    LUTDeCrawl
    LUTDeRainbow
    GrainStabilizeMC
    SMDegrain - Added 'MVglobal' and 'dct' parameters to be able to set the 'global' and 'dct' of MAnalyse.
    SmoothLevels
    FastLineDarken 1.4x MT MOD
    GammaToLinear, LinearToGamma, SigmoidInverse, SigmoidDirect
    LSFmod - Added 'noring' parameter to indicate that a non-ringing algorithm must be used in case of supersampling.
    GrainFactory3


Since VapourSynth has no notion of field order internally, I have to add a mandatory argument 'TFF' to QTGMC for the script to work correctly. Setting TFF to true means top field first and false means bottom field first. You will get error if TFF is not set. The same thing applies to SMDegrain and ivtc_txt60mc.

BTW, Yadif seems can't be loaded in VapourSynth successfully, so I changed the default EdiMode of "Ultra Fast" preset to nnedi3 in QTGMC.

Usage Example:
Firstly, put havsfunc.py to Python\Lib\site-packages.

Code:
import vapoursynth as vs
import havsfunc
core = vs.get_core()
haf = havsfunc.HAvsFunc()
# Load the needed plugins #
clip = yourclip
clip = haf.QTGMC(clip, Preset='Medium', TFF=True)
