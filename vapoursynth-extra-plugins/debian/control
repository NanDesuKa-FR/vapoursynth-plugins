Description: Additional plugins for VapourSynth
 It's an application for video manipulation. Or a plugin. Or a library.
 It's hard to tell because it has a core library written in C++ and a
 Python module to allow video scripts to be created. It came to be when
 I started thinking about alternative designs for Avisynth and most of
 it was written over a 3 month period. The software has been heavily inspired
 by Avisynth and aims to be a 21st century rewrite, taking advantage of
 the advancements computers have made since the late 90s. The main
 features compared to Avisynth are:
 .
  * Multithreaded - Frame level multithreading
  * Generalized Colorspaces - New Colorspaces can be specified at runtime
  * Per Frame Properties - Additional metadata can be attached to frames
  * Python Based - The scripting part is implemented as a Python module so
    you don't have to learn a special language
  * Support for video with format changes - Some video just can't stick to
    one format or frame size VapourSynth can handle any kind of change
