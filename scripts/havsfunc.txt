HolyWu:

Here is my ported AviSynth scripts for VapourSynth.

Now includes:
    daa
    santiag
    Deblock_QED
    DeHalo_alpha - Added noring parameter to indicate that a non-ringing algorithm must be used in case of supersampling.
    YAHR
    HQDering mod
    QTGMC - Add KNLMeansCL as another Denoiser to NoiseProcess. Renamed DftThreads parameter to FftThreads, to set the ncpu argument of FFT3DFilter.
    ivtc_txt60mc
    logoNR
    Vinverse
    Vinverse2
    LUTDeCrawl
    LUTDeRainbow
    GrainStabilizeMC
    SMDegrain - Added MVglobal and dct parameters to be able to set the global and dct arguments of MAnalyse.
    STPresso
    SigmoidInverse, SigmoidDirect
    GrainFactory3
    SmoothLevels
    FastLineDarken 1.4x MT MOD
    LSFmod - Added noring parameter to indicate that a non-ringing algorithm must be used in case of supersampling.


Since VapourSynth has no notion of field order internally, I have to add a mandatory argument 'TFF' to QTGMC for the script to work correctly. Setting TFF to true means top field first and false means bottom field first. You will get error if TFF is not set. The same thing applies to SMDegrain and ivtc_txt60mc.

BTW, Yadif seems can't be loaded in VapourSynth successfully, so I changed the default EdiMode of "Ultra Fast" preset to nnedi3 in QTGMC.

Usage Example:
Firstly, put havsfunc.py to Python\Lib\site-packages.

Code:
import vapoursynth as vs
import havsfunc
core = vs.get_core()
haf = havsfunc.HAvsFunc()
# Load the needed plugins #
clip = yourclip
clip = haf.QTGMC(clip, Preset='Medium', TFF=True)
